# FEATURES.md — Features & UI Behaviour

## 1. Search

- A text input and a "Search" button are always visible at the top of the page
- Pressing Enter inside the input triggers the same action as clicking Search
- If the input is empty when Search is triggered → show notification: `"Please enter a search value!"`
- If the API returns no results → show notification: `"No countries found for '{query}'."`
- On a successful search → clear any existing notification and render the results

## 2. Country Cards

Each result is displayed as a card. Every card must show:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Flag | Use the `flags.png` URL as an `<img>`. Use `flags.alt` as the `alt` attribute |
| Country name | Use `name.common` |
| Population | Formatted with thousands separators (e.g. `44,012,345`) |
| Capital | Use `capital[0]`. If missing, show `"N/A"` |
| Wikipedia link | A clickable link labelled `"Open on Wikipedia"` — opens in a new tab |

Wikipedia URL format:
```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{name.common with spaces replaced by underscores}
```

## 3. Quick Access Buttons

Three buttons appear above the results:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 🇪🇺 Europe | Fetch all countries in the Europe region |
| 🤝 Neighbors of Macedonia | Fetch Macedonia first, extract `borders`, then fetch all border countries |
| 🦅 Macedonia | Fetch Macedonia by code `MKD` |

All three buttons follow the same flow: show loader → fetch → hide loader → render results (or show error).

## 4. Loading State

- Show a visible loading indicator whenever a fetch is in progress
- Hide it as soon as the fetch resolves or rejects
- While loading, disable the Search button and Quick buttons to prevent duplicate requests

## 5. Notifications

- Displayed in a dedicated notification area between the search bar and the results
- Types: `warning` (user input errors), `error` (API/network failures), `info` (general messages)
- Each type has a distinct visual style (color-coded)
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds, or dismissed immediately when a new successful result loads

## 6. Sort (Optional but encouraged)

A "Sort by ⇅" button opens a small dropdown menu with these options:

- Name A → Z
- Name Z → A
- Population ↑
- Population ↓
- Area ↑
- Area ↓

Selecting an option sorts the **currently displayed** results in place — no new API call is made. The `SortMenu` class emits a callback with `(field, direction)` and `CountryList` re-renders with the sorted data.

## 7. General UX Rules

- The page never reloads — all updates are DOM manipulation
- Results replace the previous results (no pagination, no infinite scroll)
- If 0 results come back from the API, show an informative notification instead of an empty list
